            <center><h1>MY VESRSION OF OUR STORY</h1>
          <p>If you told First Year Quarter 2 Me that by the end of the year I would be a rondom boy I met at an STK110 pracs girlfriend, I would call you crazy ngl.
            From the moment I met Phathu, the relationship bell did not ring. Cupid was no where to be found. Till this day, I am questioning his survival skills
            because why the heck are you trying to give a stranger a hug? In this economy nakhona? I Could have swipped your pods quick quick and sold them.
          Speaking of pods, Mr Sir here left those everywhere. No.. Why was he stresing me before we even started dating, question... Like from leaving his bag
          on the monestry stools to the way he aggresively eats his popcorn to calling me on the 25th of April 2024 while I was on the bus going home to ask for help
         on an STK110 prac that was due that very same day. I am an unpaid gardian angel, gardian of the galaxy call me Star-lord. I like to think of myself as more of
         a Mnatis though but anyways moving on...</p>

         <p>I should have known the day he akwardly called me to ask how my day was that something was up but the girl was in her delusional era, I gaslight myself into
          thinking that all he wanted was a friendship. All of that changed the day he called to ask if his friendzone status was permanent, at that point I did not even
          know the answer to that question myself because it was something that I did not think about and that is exactly what I said that I did not know. Moving on...
          I do not know why it did not click that one Saturday that we spent talking instead of doing stats and also he showed me the pond on campus and we walked
          to the bridge to look at the view. Oh my days I am "i like you" blind fr.
        </p>

        <p>
My friends told me to give him a chance because I had nothing to lose and so I did, I gave him a chance. Our first "date" was when we went to the art gallery on campus.
I remember him posting something weird oh his status the week of our art gallery "date", something about his Twin approving and he is going too ask the question on Friday.
We were meeting on Friday!! and I was confused because what the heck do you want to ask me? Friday came and I was not feeling a hundred but anyways, We met up and it was an Okay "date"
ngl. It was on that "date" where I decided that I will give him a chance. His goals were similar to mine and I enjoyed the conversation. The question of that day was "Can you please be my girlfriend?"
At that point I did not know him like that and I wanted to be asked in a meaningful way so I said no.
        </p>

        <p>
        The getting to know him stage was really nice because I found myself liking him more and more with each conversation and with each meet up. I did not fully trust Kea because
        in our friendship stage he talked about all his talking stages and people he was involved with so yeah. He talked about how if he were to find a girl he wanted to persue, he would
        cut off all the girls on his contact list. "latoyass lies". The lies were too much for me. At some point he blocked me from viewing his status and then proceeded to give me some
        dumb excuse about his past. He said he used to sell weed or some dumb thing like that. I never understood why the heck he would lie to me like that, do I look that gullible? anyways
        moving on.. In the stage of him trying to bag me, I would see him on campus with other huns. So funny Mr I will cut off all the girls in my contact list.
        </p>

        <p>
        Our second date was at a rugby game. I am not a big fan of rugby but yeah I went. I hate the smell of alcohol because it makes me nauseous and he drank that day. I wore blue because
        he supports the Blue Bulls, standard procedure. He woke up late for the EKN110 exam that day and this girl texted him right asking how he was and everything, cool. Now tell me why
        when we met up the next week, baby girls chat was empty. The crime scene had been cleaned. He was on some, "nahh it was nothing important". I should have taken the hint then that this boy
        is playing in my face. Anyways back to the rugby game date. The night ended with him trying to kiss me, he failed. I was standing on business that day.
        </p>

        <p>
        The first time he said the 3 words was in the midst of an argument and all I said in that moment was Okay. He had shown me multiple times that he hates me because why would he
        play with my feelings that many times? He obviously hated my guts and I stayed, lol akere ke clown and stuff. I later on responded to his question and we started dating. He was my man.
        I still did not trust him though and my body just could not show him public affection because something in me just kept saying that he is playing in my face, regardless, I was ready to love
        him. I would say that I showed up and showed off in that relationship. I was a gone girl. Unlike my other relationships, I gave more than I took. I tried my best.
        </p>

        <p>
        The best that I gave was not enough to hold him down because he was still entertaining other girls, playing with my feelings. His excuse was that he was not sure about me and so
        he was keeping his options open and whatever. The first time that I found out about his betrayal, I was crushed ngl because I kept asking myself what I did so wrong for me to
be treated so poorly by a guy who claims to love me. I was hurt and yet I gave him a second chance. Then I found out again. His excuse was that he thought I took him back because I wanted
revenge. Me? Revenge? Come On Dude.
        </p>

        <p>
        We listen and we do not judge, I gave him a third chance. The chance that led to this website. He erased everything from his phone and he went off social media so he says.
        Whenever we link, his phone is switched off. He speaks about his male friends but never utters a word about his female ones, they only come up in calls and not calls with me but with his
        friends. I keep bringing up the past to understand what the heck happend and that is only hurting him. I am trying to move on and just trust him again but I do not think I can do that ever.
        I am not that strong. I am hurting and I need to heal so this website serves as a memorial of our once beautiful relationship.
        </p>

        <p>
        Thank you for sharing parts of you with me. Thank you for trusting me with your deepest darkest secrets. Thank you for trying new things with me and for all the movies we started
        and never finished. Thank you for listening to me yap and all the memories we made together. Farewell and I wish you nothing but the best. You are amazing, I love you so much pookie.
